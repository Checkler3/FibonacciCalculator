# FibonacciCalculator
Old Calculator created in my Database and Algorithms Class that calculates some n number of the fibonacci sequence. 

There are two classes within. 


### Fibonacci.java
More conventional method of finding numbers comprised of calculating the previous two fibonacci numbers and returning that value. This method is very slow, and can take a very long time to compute larger values.


### FastFibonacci.java 
Updated algorithm for finding the sequence. This class uses methods that will increase compute time by using a while loop for each value of n in the sequence.
